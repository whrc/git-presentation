## Open Science

European Commission, 2016:

> Open Science represents a new approach to the scientific process based on **cooperative work** and new ways of **diffusing knowledge** by using **digital technologies** and new **collaborative tools**.  

OECD, 2015:  

> "(...) to make the primary outputs of **publicly funded research results** – publications and the research data – **publicly accessible in digital format** with no or minimal restriction.  

## Are there some principles for going open?

Using FAIR principles ([go-fair.org](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)), i.e. improving:  
- **F**indability  
- **A**ccessibility  
- **I**nteroperability  
- **R**euse  

## How can we make data and code publicly accessible?

Storage of data and big files:

## With Git we can

- Easily share code and analysis results with colleagues and supervisor  
- Track changes in the source code or files, and use this as a progress checker or management tool  
- Enable collaboration between peers (non-linear development)
- Genuinely make open science  

## Before going over the live demo...

Follow the instructions on [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en):  
1. [Create a GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account).  
2. [Download Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git).  
3. Set a [SSH connection](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/about-ssh) between your computer and GitHub.    
4. Use Git + GitHub, the most common commands are described in:
